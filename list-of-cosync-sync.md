# List of Cosynchronizable -> Synchronizable Systems

A lot of real world systems have a natural hierachy of type `cosynchronizable -> synchronizable`.

It means that there is some kind of "center" which is related to some kind of "circumference" through some intermediate medium.

This list is created to build intuition about such systems.

### Bee Hives

- Bees are cosynchronizable to the bee queen
- Bees are synchronizable to flowers

### Multiplication, Primes and Natural Numbers

- Primes are cosynchronizable to multiplication
- Primes are synchronizable to natural numbers

### Photo Albums, Tourists and Tourist Attractions

- Tourists' photos are cosynchronizable to photo albums
- Tourists' cameras are synchronizable to tourist attractions

### Physical Simulations, Center of Mass and Continuous Objects

- Center of mass is cosynchronizable chaos attractor to physical simulations
- Center of mass is synchronizable chaos attractor to continuous objects

### Temples, Pilgrims and Offerings

- Pilgrims are cosynchronizable to temples
- Pilgrims are synchronizable to offerings

### Video Tapes

- The target position of a video tape is cosynchronizable to the read/write head
- The target position of a video tape is synchronizable to positions in general on the video tape

### Web Browsers, TCP/IP Packages, Servers

- Received TCP/IP packages are cosynchronizable to web browsers
- TCP/IP packages requests are synchronizable to servers
